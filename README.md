⚠️ If the Project Shows “Not a Valid Unity Project”
---------------------------------------------------
When you download the ZIP from GitHub, the extracted folder may contain an extra parent folder with the same name.
Because of this, Unity Hub might say:

“This project is not valid.”

If that happens, follow these steps:

✅ How to Fix
--------------
Open the extracted ZIP folder.

Inside it, look for a second folder with the same project name.

Drag the inner folder (the one that contains Assets, ProjectSettings, Packages) to a location of your choice.

Add that folder to Unity Hub.

Your folder structure should look like this:

ProjectName/
 ├── Assets/
 ├── Packages/
 ├── ProjectSettings/
 └── UserSettings/ (optional)


If Unity recognizes these three folders, the project will open normally.
